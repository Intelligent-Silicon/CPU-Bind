# CPU-Bind

## Overview

This App demonstrates how to fetch the CPU core data.

Set the Cores the App can run on (Affinity Mask). Currently limited to 32bit variables and thus the first 32 CPU cores.

Passes the core number a thread can run on, and switches it to the correct core if the thread starts on the wrong core.


### Todo
Swap 32bit variables out for 64bit variables so all 64 core options can be used.

### Demo App

CPUBind.EXE compiled as a Standalone EXE so it doesnt need any Clarion Runtime DLL'S, just download and run.
